    // - write blocks executing queue, but is executed asynchronously on a calling queue so it doesn't have to wait
    // note:
    //  it's fine to have async write, and sync reads, because write blocks queue and reads are executed synchronously;
    //  so if we want ro read after writing, we'll still be waiting (reads are sync) for write to finish and allow reads to execute;
