This guide shows how to add, configure, and track events for a Swift application utilizing the Tealium Swift Integration library.

Before you begin, here's a video introduction to the platform:

# Features
The following [features](https://community.tealiumiq.com/t5/Mobile-Libraries/Installation-Libraries-Feature-List/ta-p/18159) are available with the Swift library:
* App Data

NOTE: 
Recently removed variables / event-attribute keys. Use the newer *tealium_event* instead:
- event_name


# INSTALLATION

## Requirements
Before proceeding, ensure you have satisfied the following requirements:
* Tealium account enabled for [Cloud Delivery](https://community.tealiumiq.com/t5/Universal-Data-Hub/Cloud-Delivery-Connectors/ta-p/13889)
* Swift 3.0+
* Xcode 8.0+

Platforms supported:
* iOS 9.0+
* macOS 10.11+
* tvOS 9.2+
* watchOS 3.0+
* server-side deployments

## Dependency manager

### Modules Included

### Carthage
Carthage is a simple way to manage dependencies in Swift. Install [Carthage from Github](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) or via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with the following terminal command:

```
$ brew install carthage
```
Then add the following entry to the [Cartfile](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md#cartfile) in your project:
```
github "tealium/tealium-swift" 
```
Then update from the terminal with:
```
$ carthage update
```
This will produce frameworks for the following platforms:
* iOS
* macOS
* tvOS
* watchOS 

To build only for a particular platform, use Carthage's *--platform* argument:
```
$ carthage update --platform ios
```

See the [Modules List](#modules-list) section to see which modules are included with the current library via Carthage.


## Manual Import
Import the Tealium folder into your project.

Watch this video for an overview of the installation and setup of the code:

[![Swift Implementation Video](http://res.cloudinary.com/dfpz40r7j/image/upload/v1498577063/SwiftImplementation_fhnnyx.png)](https://youtu.be/yPecyFKQLuA)

### Disabling Modules
* For Manual Import ONLY: Remove the target module files from the build target. This will prevent the modules from being compiled into the release product (most code optimal)
* Use the TealiumModulesList property that may be assigned to a [TealiumConfig](/support/docs/swift_tealiumconfig.md) object to explicitly white or black list modules for enablement. This is the recommmended way to enable or disable modules. 
```swift
// Sample
// This will load all modules except the TagManagment module.
let list = TealiumModulesList(isWhitelist: false, 
moduleNames: ["TagManagment"])
let config = // See TealiumConfig example below
config.setModulesList(list)
```

## Initialization
Once the Tealium for Swift is installed you are ready to start coding. A Tealium instance must be configured with an instance of a TealiumConfig with the following parameters:
* account - the name of your iQ account
* profile - the name of the mobile profile within your iQ account
* environment - typically "dev", "qa", or "prod"
* datasource - (optional) data source key from UDH
``` swift
    var tealConfig = TealiumConfig(account: "your_account",
                                             profile: "your_profile",
                                             environment: "prod",
                                             datasource: "abc123")

    let tealium = Tealium(config: tealConfig)
```

## Tracking
All tracking is done with the track() method, which takes the following parameters:
* title - the name of the screen view or event to be tracked
* data - (optional) [String:Any] dictionary of additional/custom tracking data
* completion - (optional) a closure to be run upon completion of the tracking call

NOTE: A dispatch service module ([**collect**](#modules-list) or [**tagmanagement**](#modules-list)) must be enabled to deliver track calls.
```swift

    // With optional parameters - any optional param may take *nil*
    let customData = [ "someKey" : "someValue" ]
    tealium.track(title:"someEventWithOptionalArgs", 
                  data: customData,
                  completion: { (success, info, error) in

        // Any follow-up code here

    })
```


## Modules

This library is built with the capability to easily add or remove feature sets during compile time (manual imports) or at initialization time. Sets of features are separated into subclasses of the TealiumModule class, and are currently contained in individually titled subfolders.

### Required Components

The core folder contains all the required classes of the library. Additionally, one Dispatch Service module, Collect or [TagManagement](https://community.tealiumiq.com/t5/Mobile-Libraries/Tealium-Swift-Module-TagManagement/ta-p/16857) is required to process and deliver track calls to Tealium.

### Modules List

The following table lists the currently available modules and related details.  
* *Module Name:* Name id of Module.

# Change Log

- 1.3.1
    - Builder (used by Carthage) updated to include previously missing TealiumMulticastDelegate & TealiumLifecyclePersistentData classes in build target.
    - AppData Module (build 3) fix for app_version & added new key-value:
        - app_build (application build number)
    - Async Module (build 4) added os x version check for dispatch queue assignment.
    - Delegate Module (build 3) removed unused code.

- 1.3.0
    - All modules updated to make use of simplified modules base class + new internal TealiumRequest structs that replaces the TealiumProcess & TealiumTrack structs
    - Most module related files have been aggregated into single module class files for faster reference & future removal of the module subfolders.
    - Added Connectivity module (build 1). Queues track calls if connectivity not available. Resends in FIFO order when connectivity again available when another track occurrs. Adds following auto variable:
        - was_queued (true if call was queued)
    - Added DataStorage module (build 1) that replaces the persistent data module's internal functions. Primarily for tvOS.
    - Added FileStorage module (build 1) that replaces the persistent data modules internal functions. For all other target platforms.
    - Added TealiumModulesList that can be assigned to TealiumConfig to explicit enable or disable modules. Struct has following properties:
        - isWhitelist: Bool
        - modulesName: Set<String>
    - Added additional core internal classes:  
        - TealiumModules
        - TealiumMulticastDelegate
        - TealiumRequestArray
    - Updated Core Tealium (build 3) with track type call marked deprecated in favor of simpler track method. Updated to use internal TealiumTrackRequest over TealiumTrack. Added new APIs to update library instance with newer configuration:
        - update(config: TealiumConfig)
    - Updated Core TealiumConfig (build 2) convenience constructor added. 1.0.1 Deprecated legacy methods removed.
    - Updated Core Constants (build 2) replaced internal track & process struct with new request protocol and request types.
    - Updated Core TealiumModule base class (build 3) to support new request structs.Made equatable & hashable. ModuleConfig made a class level func for better init performance. Simplified process completion methods. Removed an internal protocol requirement.
    - Updated Core TealiumModuleManager (build 3) to support updated request structs.
    - Updated Core TealiumUtils (build 2) updated multicast delegate to take explicit delegate type at init time.
    - Updated AppData module (build 2) to support new persistence related requests & to provide required new data in event no persistent modules enabled. Remaining app data key-values added:
        - app_name
        - app_rdns
        - app_version
    - Updated Attribution module (build 3) to use new internal request structs.
    - Updated Autotracking module (build 3) to use new internal request structs.

    - Updated DataSource module (build 2) to use new internal request structs.
    - Updated Delegate module (build 2) to store multicast delegate in config instead of within module. Prepares it for further delegate options moving forward.

    - Updated Logger module (build 2) Extension to set log levels via TealiumConfig re-enabled. Logs success or failures of save, load, & track requests + use new internal request structs. LogLevel renamed TealiumLogLevel to avoid namespace collisions for manually imported implementations.
    - Updated PersistentData module (build 2) to use new internal structs.
    - Updated RemoteCommands module (build 2) to use new internal structs. Files aggregated into a single TealiumRemoteCommandsModule.swift file.
