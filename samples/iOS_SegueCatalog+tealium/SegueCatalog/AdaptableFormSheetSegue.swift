/**
    This segue subclass demonstrates how to adapt a view controller that has been
    modally presented by a segue. An instance of this segue is triggered by the 
    Form Sheet nav item owned by an OuterViewController. It is configured to show 
    a Form Sheet presentation, but Form Sheets are not permissible in Compact 
    size classes. By default, UIKit will adapt a Form Sheet presentation to a
    full-screen presentation, using the same view controller. We would like to 
    provide an alternative representation in the adapted case.

            to act as the presentation controller's delegate and customize any 
            adaptation.
